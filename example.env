# Universal scraper parameters (used by all scrapers)
# MAX_PAGES: maximum number of pages to scrape
# - Higher values scrape more content but take longer
# - Lower values for faster scraping but may miss content
MAX_PAGES=10

# MAX_GRANTS: maximum number of grants to process per run
# - Higher values process more grants but take longer and use more OpenAI API calls
# - Lower values for faster runs and lower costs but may miss some grants
# - Set to 0 or very high number (999) to process all found grants
MAX_GRANTS=100

# BATCH_SIZE: number of grants to process in parallel
# - Higher values = faster processing but more resource usage
# - Lower values = slower but more stable processing
# - Recommended: 3-7 (optimal balance of speed and stability)
BATCH_SIZE=30

# BATCH_DELAY: delay in milliseconds between batches
# - Higher values = more polite to the server, lower chance of rate limiting
# - Lower values = faster processing but higher chance of being blocked
# - Recommended: 500-2000ms
BATCH_DELAY=500

# MAX_LOAD_MORE: maximum number of "Load More" or pagination clicks
# - Higher values load more content but increase scraping time
# - Lower values for faster scraping but may miss content
MAX_LOAD_MORE=10

# EU_CONTENT_WAIT_TIME: wait time in milliseconds for EU Portal content to load
# - EU Portal pages have dynamic content that loads after page navigation
# - Higher values = more reliable content extraction but slower scraping
# - Lower values = faster scraping but may miss content that loads slowly
# - Recommended: 3000-8000ms (3-8 seconds)
EU_CONTENT_WAIT_TIME=6000
